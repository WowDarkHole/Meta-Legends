<h1 class="mb-10 lg:mb-20 text-3xl lg:text-5xl text-center">Official Press Release</h1>

<p class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg my-5 lg:my-10 italic">
    This press release was written on November 27, 2021
</p>

<p class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg my-5 lg:my-10">
    Before we get started, let’s take a look at some of the highlights from the last few weeks:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg">
    <li>Within 24-hours, 37,000 people joined our Discord </li>
    <li>As of today, we now have 137,000 members on our Discord</li>
    <li>38,000 followers on Twitter</li>
    <li>26,000 followers on Instagram</li>
    <li>Easter Eggs in all four corners of the world</li>
    <li>Received overwhelming enthusiasm from the community regarding this project</li>
    <li>$1.4M in NFTs sold in the first four minutes after Minting</li>
</ul>

<p class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg my-5 lg:my-10">
    No one can take these stats away from us. Despite the results of the Mint following the unfortunate hacking attack, we’ve managed to create a strong movement and community.
    <br><br>
    Whereas many projects would have never recovered from such a devastating blow, you’ve decided to take up arms and defend the project you believe in more than anything. 
    <br><br>
    Among more than 1,500 investors, over 95% have decided to HOLD their NFTs as opposed to selling them on Opensea or selling them at a minimum of 1 ETH to raise the floor price.
    <br><br>
    Once again, these statistics highlight the confidence and commitment our investors have in both our company and this project. 
    <br><br>
    There’s no doubt that these types of events are certainly problematic in the short term; however, the potential and the long-term vision of Meta Legends are the reason investors refuse to sell.

</p>

<p class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg my-5 lg:my-10">
    That said, let’s go back to what occurred during the launch... 
</p>

<p class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg my-5 lg:my-10">
    A group of experienced hackers located a vital flaw in our website and took advantage of it to blackmail us. 
    <br><br>
    By the time we realized what was happening, it was already too late. We had lost the opportunity to negotiate — the damage was irreversible. 
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold my-5 lg:my-10 underline lg:mt-40">Action taken as a result:</h2> 

<p class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg my-5 lg:my-10">
    We reacted shortly after the end of the Dutch Auction and held several crisis meetings with our team. 
    <br><br>
    We then immediately organized several AMAs to answer any questions the community had.
    <br><br> 
    Finally, we created the first DAO related to the project. Now, both holders and board members have the opportunity to have their voices heard regarding all major project decisions. 
</p>

    <img class="rounded-lg lg:rounded-xl" src="../assets/images/blogposts/blogpost-2/image-8.png" alt="">
</div>

<h2 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold my-5 lg:my-10 lg:mt-40 underline">The DAO’s decisions are as follows: </h2>

<ul class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg my-5 lg:my-10 list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Closing of the mint</li>
    <li>
        <span class="font-bold">Public sale scheduled for Saturday, December 11, 2021, at 4pm UTC</span>
        <br><br>
        <span class="italic lg:ml-5">There are two possibilities regarding the public sale :</span>
        <ul class="list-decimal list-inside my-5 lg:ml-5">
            <li>Mint a Meta Legend at 0.3 (fixed price)</li>
            <li>Mint a Meta Legend + Meta life perks (price varies depending on perks)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">New date for the WL mint: Sunday, December 12, 2021, at 4pm UTC (possibility of mint within 24h)</span></li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">New date for the Reveal: Monday, December 13, 2021</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="font-bold text-xl lg:text-2xl underline lg:mt-40 mb-4">Other important decisions:</h2>
<p class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg">
    <span class="underline">1) The creation of an Angel Sweeper role</span>
    <br><br>
    Anyone who redeems the floor price at less than 1 ETH and puts it back on the market for a minimum of +1 ETH, will unlock the Angel Sweeper role and get a custom weapon in Meta Life.
    <br>
    The NFT shouldn't be relisted or sold before a 1 month period.<br>
    1 sweep = 1 weapon <br>
    2 sweeps = 2 weapons <br>
    etc... <br> 
    If you sell your NFT 1eth or more on opensea, you still keep the weapon(s).<br>
    You'll have then to submit your wallet adress or opensea profile in a dedicated channel to be reviewed and approved
    <br><br>
    The angel sweeper role will be given to people who sweeped the floor before the public mint and during one month, if you buy during and after mint on opensea you will not be considered as an angel sweeper.
    <br><br>
    <span class="underline">2) NFT for Genesis Buyers</span>
    <br><br>
    Anyone who minted before November 25 is considered a Genesis Buyer. All Holders will have the opportunity to mint a Meta Legend for free beginning December 25th. 
    <br><br>
    <span class="underline">3) WL Benefits</span>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg">
        <li>Perks include armor / exclusive vehicles / pets </li>
        <li>All WLs will have the possibility to mint a Meta Legend for free three months later if they are holders.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg my-5 lg:my-10">
    More decisions by the board are soon to come.

<h2 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold underline my-5 lg:my-10 lg:mt-40">In conclusion...</h2>

<p class="lg:leading-8 lg:text-lg my-5 lg:my-10">
    The Meta Legends team is highly skilled and continues to work every day to make this project a success.
    <br><br>
    We’d like to take a moment to thank the community for their support. It’s their guidance that keeps us going in the right direction. We have a firm vision for Meta Legends — failure is not an option. As such, it’s important to us that our community be proud of us.
    <br><br>
    We’ll be in touch soon with more information regarding the action taken to ensure the new public sale is a success.
    <br><br>
    We don't have the budget of Facebook, Niantic, or Epic Games. This project began with a vision, a close-knit team, and our own pocket money. From here, we’ve managed to create a community complete with AAA designs and marketing campaigns that other big companies can only dream of. 
    <br><br>
    <br><br>
    Let's write history together...
